# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code is functional and secure I created JUnit tests. When creating these tests, it was important to test all aspects including testing valid inputs as well as invalid inputs. In some cases, it was important to create variables with the class name in it to not confuse similar code in another class when testing. If I did not and in the case that these got mixed up, it may have passed the test but not actually adding/updating/deleting from the correct array (list). To further ensure that this testing worked and there was not any 'dead' code, I referenced the coverage percentage of each test/class.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I incorporated the users needs by ensuring that the correct character limit and the inability to be null for each task, contact, and appointment were included. Furthermore, when testing these restrictions I included sample data that should, and did, come out as false. In addition, the user needed to be able to add, delete, and update the given class (task, contact, and appointment).
